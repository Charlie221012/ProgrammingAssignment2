## The function cacheSolve returns the inverse of a matrix A created with
## the makeCacheMatrix function.
## If the cached inverse is available, cacheSolve retrieves it, while if
## not, it computes, caches, and returns it.
# cacheSolve: Compute the inverse of the matrix. If the inverse is already
# calculated before, it returns the cached inverse.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
	## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinv()

    # If the inverse is already calculated, return it
    if (!is.null(inv)) {

    # The inverse is not yet calculated, so we calculate it
